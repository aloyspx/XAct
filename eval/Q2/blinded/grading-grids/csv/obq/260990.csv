OBLIQUE
Item,Comments,Scale (1-3)
Rotation of the Hand,"Confirm the hand has been rotated correctly for the oblique view, typically 45 degrees."
Palm Placement,The palm of the hand should be 45 degrees with the receptor.
Thumb Placement,The thumb should be slightly abducted from the rest of the fingers.
Finger Placement,Ensure that all fingers are in a neutral position and extended. Avoid overlapping or rotation of fingers.
Wrist Position,"Ensure the wrist is in the same plane as the hand, avoiding any undue flexion or extension."
Carpal Bones Overlap,"In an oblique view, some degree of overlapping of the carpal bones is expected due to the rotation of the hand. However, the degree of overlap may vary depending on the angle of obliquity. For example, in a 45-degree oblique view, you should be able to see more of the individual carpal bones compared to the PA view, particularly the scaphoid, lunate, and triquetral."
Carpal Joint Spaces,The joint spaces between the carpal bones should be visible and uniform.
Phalangeal Joint Spaces,The joint spaces in the fingers should be evenly spaced and clearly visible.
Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) Joint Alignment,"The MCP joints should be well-aligned, with the long axis of each metacarpal aligning with the long axis of each proximal phalanx in the fingers."
