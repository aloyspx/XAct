LATERAL
Item,Comments,Scale (1-3)
Rotation of the Hand,"In the true lateral position, the hand should be rotated 90 degrees from the PA position with the thumb up if the patient's arm position allows. The hand and wrist should be in the same plane."
Palm Placement,The palm of the hand should be 90 degrees with the receptor.
Thumb Placement,"The thumb should be extended and away from the rest of the fingers, so it doesn't superimpose on the other structures and can be clearly seen. In this view, the profile of the thumb should be clearly outlined."
Finger Placement,"The fingers should be superimposed upon one another in a relaxed and natural bent position. In a correct lateral view, the phalanges, metacarpals, and carpals should be superimposed, while the thumb is free of superimposition."
Wrist Position,The wrist should be in a neutral position and in line with the forearm. This view can help identify dorsal or volar displacement of the carpal bones.
Carpal Bones Overlap,"In a lateral view, the carpal bones will naturally overlap, but you should still be able to identify the individual bones."
Carpal Joint Spaces,The spaces between the carpal bones may be less distinct due to overlap.
Phalangeal Joint Spaces,"In a lateral view, these spaces may not be clearly visible due to the superimposition of the fingers."
Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) Joint Alignment,"If they are visible, the MCP joints should be well-aligned, with the long axis of each metacarpal aligning with the long axis of each proximal phalanx in the fingers"
