Rotation of the Hand,Check for proper rotation of the hand by examining the alignment of the metacarpals and phalanges. The fingers should be straight without overlapping.
Palm Placement,"The palm of the hand should be in full contact with the receptor, with the fingers fully extended and slightly separated."
Thumb Placement,"Verify that the thumb is not superimposed with the metacarpals, especially the second and third metacarpals. The thumb should be slightly abducted from the rest of the fingers."
Finger Placement,Ensure that all fingers are in a neutral position and extended. Avoid overlapping or rotation of fingers.
Wrist Position,"The wrist should be in a neutral position, not flexed or extended."
Carpal Bones Overlap,"Assess the overlap of the carpal bones to ensure that they are symmetrically aligned without any superimposition, which could obscure structures of interest."
Carpal Joint Spaces,"Evaluate the joint spaces between the carpal bones for uniformity, ensuring that they are clearly visible and not compressed or widened."
Phalangeal Joint Spaces,Measure the joint spaces between the phalanges to verify if they are symmetrical and not obscured by overlapping structures.
Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) Joint Alignment,Examine the alignment of the metacarpal heads with the phalanges to ensure that they are in a straight line without any rotational displacement.
